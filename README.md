# Devsnest-DSA 

(In-Progress)

Here lies all the THAs and Class problems (Leetcode) tracked, solved, or atleast tried during my DEVSNEST journey.

Maybe in future it will be organised, with specially curated FOLDER. (MAYBE.......)

### Languages I'm using as of right now: 

- JAVA

### Extentions used: 

- [Java]() : The compiler or the chad. Nothing gets done without it.

- [Code Runner]() : Code go BRRRRR......

- [Prettier]() : Just don't code without it please. Makes you pretty.

- [CPH HELPHER]() : For easy sample inputs integration directly from the site. No need to type all the input ever again. Requires chrome extension.

#### Also thanks [Pathetic_geek](https://github.com/patheticGeek) for this OP Idea. Pathetic only by name , Can finds bugs in your code from a mile far but not his Crush's hints.
